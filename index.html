            <p>
                I started losing my hair since I was 18 years old, that's why my friends call me "el pelón". I have
                always
                been proud of it (after all, it's all due to an excess in
                testosterone) and I have adopted the shaved head look since then. <br><br>

                I was born in a cold winter day in Sweden in 1979, in a town called Varberg, but was raised in
                Kungsbacka, a
                town about 45 minutes from Gothenburg. My first
                18 years of life consisted of constant moving from one country to another. I have lived in Sweden,
                Mexico,
                Spain, Perú, and Colombia. <br><br>

                I married in 2006, at San Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato, and I am the proud father of two beatiful
                children, Nina who is 11 years old, and Emil who is 4
                years old. <br><br>

                I try to excercise at least three times per week and in my free time (almost unexistant) I love to read
                and
                do some carpentry and fixes in the house, I
                am what we call in Mexico a "talachas"
